# Digital-Academy-Website-Project

This is a personal project I created using my recent skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website is three-page design that show my abilities in front-end development.
The project is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be access at https://azimeulker.github.io/Digital-Academy-Website-Project/.
